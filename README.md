# dmpsArDrone

This repository corresponds to the Robot Learning  project. It contains a ROS package to be developed to implement DMPs in an AR Drone 2.0 quadrotor in order to learn generalized trajectories. It also includes some metafiles.

The ROS package is being developped in Ubuntu 14.04/indigo and assumes that the user has the following packages:

- ardrone_autonomy: 
  Can be easily installed as an Ubuntu package with 
```shell
sudo apt-get install ros-ROSDISTRO-ardrone-autonomy
```
- ar_tools for ROS:
  Can be found in https://github.com/ar-tools/ar_tools.git

This repository is supposed to be cloned within a ROS workspace.
